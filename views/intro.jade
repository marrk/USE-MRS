		h2 Explanation
		p In this phase, we ask you to choose between several movies to help the system learn about your movie preferences. This means that a list of movies will be shown to you and you have to choose the one you would like to watch. You might not know all these movies, but should choose the movie you think that fits your preference best. Additional information about the movie is also available. Every time you make a choice, the system will use your previous answers to generate a next question.
		p We ask you to make a total of 10 movie choices. Upon choosing the last movie, you will automatically continue to the next step. Please acknowledge that once you made a choice, you cannot go back!
		p If you would like to see the trailer of a movie for more information, you can hover the mouse cursor over the film cover.
		p When you’ve made all the choices, you get a list of movies as your final recommendation. Kindly select which movie you prefer the best from this list. After this, you will have to fill a short questionnaire about the system and the recommendations. Lastly, don't forget to click on the ‘Finish’ button when you are done to save the results.
		p By clicking the ‘Start’ button, you confirm that you understand the methods used in this research and you confirm your participation in this research from the Human-Technology Interaction group.
		h2 Thank you.
